# Unity-Avatar-Face-control-via-webcam
This is a project that controls an avatar's facial features using a webcam that detects the human face and their facial features. 
It uses native a C++ DLL file that I created. The DLL file uses third party libraries like OpenCV and Dlib to detect the human face.
In Unity, there are C# scripts that load and use the C++ DLL file to retrieve the data and assign it to the avatar.
